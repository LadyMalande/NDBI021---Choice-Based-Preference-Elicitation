Reference git repository: https://github.com/Quang-Vinh/matrix-factorization

Work progress:
1) Use reasonable dataset, e.g. recent MovieLens 
      movie lens data set grabbed, but not filtered for recent ratings
2) Train matrix factorization (of your choice), not too many factors
      done
3) Implement representatives selection method (as in the paper or some reasonable alternative)

4) Visualize choices + feedback (working demo, but may be quite simple â€“ list titles + call function with feedback argument), iterate k-times

5) Show final recommendations: are they relevant?
